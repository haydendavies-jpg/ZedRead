---

## Phase 4 — Identity & Permissions Redesign

### Stage 15 — Rename + 5-Role Model 🚧

  Configuration, Reports, User Management, Customers & Loyalty)
- [x] `AccessProfilePagePermission` model + `access_profile_service.py` grant/revoke/resolve functions
- [x] `app/constants/license_plans.py` — per-tier page allowlists (starter/pro/enterprise)
- [x] Routes: `GET/POST /access-profiles/{id}/pages`, `DELETE .../{page_key}`, `GET .../visible-pages`
- [x] `POST /auth/portal/identity-token` — cross-identity (SuperAdmin vs User) login disambiguation
- [x] Backend rename: `portal_users` → `superadmins` (migration `0020`), `pos_users` → `users`
  (migration `0021`)
- [x] Required-field rules for Users (first/last name, PIN, email+password gating on backend access)
- [ ] Portal frontend rename: nav/routes still say "Portal Users"/"POS Users" (`Layout.tsx`)
- [ ] Portal UI for page permissions — no page calls the access-profile-pages endpoints yet
  (closed out in Stage 18)

---

## Phase 5 — Catalog Foundations

### Stage 16 — Reporting Groups 🔜

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Migration: `reporting_groups` table (brand-scoped), `ref` sequence (`RPG-000001`)
- [ ] System default reporting group seeded per brand, undeletable
- [ ] `categories.reporting_group_id` — NOT NULL FK, backfilled to each brand's default group
- [ ] Category create/update requires `reporting_group_id` (prompted in portal, enforced in service)
- [ ] Reporting Groups CRUD routes + service, block delete while categories reference it
- [ ] Portal: new sidebar page, plus required Reporting Group select added to Category modal
- [ ] `reporting_groups` page key added to `PAGE_CATALOG` and ROLE_MODEL.md §6

### Stage 17 — Delegated User Creation 🔜

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Scope-and-rank check in grant creation: creator can only grant scope ≤ their own (site/brand/group)
  and role ≤ their own highest grant; Master User excluded from delegated creation
- [ ] Audit logging on grant creation (and rejected attempts) with actor + granted scope/role
- [ ] Portal: Users create form filters scope-picker and role-picker to what the current user may grant

### Stage 18 — Permission Scopes Portal UI 🔜

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Portal page: list access profiles per scope, toggle page-level permission grants
- [ ] License-gated pages shown disabled/greyed-out with reason, not silently omitted
- [ ] Reconcile CLAUDE.md Stage 15 note and ensure ROLE_MODEL.md §6 stays in sync going forward

---

## Phase 6 — Catalog Data & Table UX

### Stage 19 — Bulk Import/Export (XLSX) 🔜

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Surface dormant `products.ref` / `categories.ref` columns (migration `0013`) into ORM model + schema
- [ ] Shared `export_service.py` / `import_service.py`: template export, filtered full export, validate-then-upsert import
- [ ] Products/Categories/Reporting Groups import matches existing rows by `ref`; partial-update
  semantics (only columns present in the uploaded header row are changed)
- [ ] Template export includes data-validation dropdowns for category/reporting-group columns
- [ ] Each import writes one `audit_logs` row per changed record, grouped by a batch `import_id`

### Stage 20 — Table UX 🔜

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Products table: Reporting Group + Category columns (via join, no denormalization)
- [ ] Inline cell edit on Products/Categories/Reporting-Groups tables
- [ ] Filter bar (category, reporting group, active/inactive, text search) reused across all three pages
- [ ] Filter bar `flex-wrap`s at 375px (CLAUDE.md rule 16)

---

## Phase 7 — Invoices & Extended Catalog

### Stage 21 — Invoice Reporting 🔜

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Invoice list filters (date range, site, payment status, amount range) + XLSX export via Stage 19 framework
- [ ] Invoice detail view: line items, modifiers, tax breakdown, payments
- [ ] Change-log panel sourced from `audit_logs` filtered by `entity_type='invoice'` (already
  populated by `invoice_service.py` — no new table)
- [ ] PDF export: standard invoice layout (recommend `weasyprint`, HTML/CSS-authored layout — no
  existing PDF generation to match style against)

### Stage 22 — Variants & Combos Portal Pages 🔜

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] `ref` sequences for Variants (`VAR-000001`) and Combos (`CMB-000001`)
- [ ] `display_name` field on `Variant` and `Combo` (not Modifiers — Modifiers stay edited inline on
  the Product page, no separate sidebar entry)
- [ ] Combined portal page: Variants + Combos in one sidebar entry, filters (by product, active state),
  inline edit, import/export via Stage 19 framework
- [ ] Product page/table shows linked variants; Variant page shows its linked product

---

## Phase 8 — POS Menu Builder

### Stage 23 — Menu Builder Prototype 🔜

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Migration: `menu_layouts` (scope, name, `is_published`, version), `menu_tabs` (ordered),
  `menu_buttons` (tab_id, product `ref` code — not FK, so a button survives product recreation)
- [ ] Portal builder UI: drag/drop tabs and buttons, live name/price preview from the catalog by code
- [ ] Publish warns if a button's code no longer resolves to an active product
- [ ] Multiple layouts may be published at once (e.g. per-site or day-part menus)
- [ ] `GET /pos/menu-layout?site_id=` contract for Android to consume (Android consumption is out of
  scope for this stage)
- [ ] Prototype scope: single-level tabs + buttons only, no nested sub-menus

---

## Phase 9 — Product Model Extensions

### Stage 24 — Product Extensions ✅

**Deliverables:**
- [x] `products.ref` wired into ORM model + schema as "product code" (migration `0037`)
- [x] `print_name` column (nullable, falls back to `name`; `effective_print_name` computed property/response field)
- [x] `is_open_item` flag; flexible price/name at time of sale, defaulting to the product's own fields
  (Android sale-time UI itself is out of scope — data model only)
- [x] `can_use_open_item` capability flag + optional `open_item_max_price_cents` ceiling on `AccessProfile`
  (a capability flag, not a page grant — it's an action permission, not a page); exposed via
  `PATCH /access-profiles/{id}/capabilities`
- [x] Photo upload cap raised 500 KB → 1 MB; 500x500 minimum resolution enforced (422 if smaller);
  1:1 ratio surfaced as portal UI guidance only, not a hard rule
- [x] `description` and `photo_url` already exist on Product — no work needed

---

## Phase 10 — Android App

### Stage 25 — Android Auth & Catalog 🚧

**Deliverables:**
- [x] Android project initialised: Kotlin + Jetpack Compose + Hilt + Retrofit + Room
- [x] Project structure: `data/`, `di/`, `ui/screens/`, `ui/components/`, `ui/viewmodel/`, `ui/theme/`
- [x] Screen scaffolding exists for: `auth/`, `cart/`, `catalog/`, `payment/`, `switchuser/`
- [x] `PosNavHost.kt` navigation graph
- [x] Backend: Migration `0011` adds access grants table extensions for management access
- [ ] POS login screen (email + password)
- [ ] PIN entry screen
- [ ] Site selector screen (for users with multi-site access)
- [ ] Product grid screen (category tabs + product tiles)
- [ ] Cart screen (line items, modifiers, quantity)
- [ ] Retrofit API client wired to backend endpoints
- [ ] Room local cache for catalog (offline-capable browsing)
- [ ] Hilt DI modules for network, database, repositories

### Stage 26 — Android Payments & Printing 🔜

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Payment screen (cash / card / voucher / split)
- [ ] Docket/receipt printing (`printing/` module scaffolded)
- [ ] Switch user flow (PIN re-entry without full logout)
- [ ] End-of-day summary screen
- [ ] Invoice history screen
- [ ] Error handling + offline sync reconciliation
- [ ] APK build + signing configuration

## Cross-Cutting — Always Active

| Concern | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Audit logging (every write) | ✅ Complete through Stage 12 |
| Structured JSON logging (structlog) | ✅ Complete |
| Request ID middleware | ✅ Complete |
| Test coverage — integration | ✅ 22 integration test files |

---

## Known Gaps & Technical Debt

| Item | Location | Priority |
|------|---------|---------|
| Circular combo reference: no DB constraint | `combo_service.py` graph traversal only | Low |
| Photo size limit: no DB constraint | `product_service.py` check only | Low |
| Invoice line `notes` column: not exposed in API | `invoice_line_items.notes` exists in model | Low |
| Split payment: backend done, Android UI pending | Stage 26 | High |
| Offline sync strategy: not documented | Android Stage 25–26 | High |
| Tax compound edge cases (PST on GST): not validated | `tax_calculation_service.py` | Medium |
| Accounting/journal integration for refunds | Not started | Future |
